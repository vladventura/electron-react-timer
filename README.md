# Timer in Electron with React
Pretty much the title. The plan is to make it as pretty as possible.

## Using
* React with useContext for state management. Might migrate to redux if the app gets big enough.
* Electron to build the standalone app.

# Roadmap
Down the line, just to make this case-study as functional as possible, I'll try add the
following functionality to the app:

* UI Cleaning
* A proper custom icon 
* Sound on the notification
    * Customize notification sounds
    * Add a default set of sounds for the notification
* Sequenced timers (For example, one to work, one to break)
* Custom notification messages for the timers

I'll try to make this my long-term prroject, mostly because it's good practice in my preferred language and it's super fun to build stuff with electron.
